# FriendFinder

Welcome to the **Friend Finder App**!


This project is an express server application that allows users to register, submit a profile picture, and then complete survey questions.  The survey results are then compared to other "friends'" results and the "friend" with the least deviation in answer from the user is selected as the most compatible match.  The friend match is then given to the user.
